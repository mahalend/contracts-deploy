# MahaLend V3 Deployments

This Node.js repository contains the configuration and deployment scripts for the MahaLend protocol core and periphery contracts. The repository makes use of `hardhat` and `hardhat-deploy` tools to facilitate the deployment of MahaLend protocol.

## Requirements

- Node.js >= 16
- Alchemy or Infura API key
  - If you use a custom RPC node, you can change the default RPC provider URL at [./helpers/hardhat-config-helpers.ts:25](./helpers/hardhat-config-helpers.ts).
- Etherscan API key _(Optional)_

## Getting Started

1. Install Node.JS dependencies:

   ```
   npm i
   ```

2. Compile contracts before running any other command, to generate Typechain TS typings:

   ```
   npm run compile
   ```
